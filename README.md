# Mirror of myfirsthtmlwebsite.neocities.org
As made on 2022-06-29, "[RETARD](https://web.archive.org/web/20220629174243/https://myfirsthtmlwebsite.neocities.org)" was a website that had very few views, according to [its now-deleted website profile page](https://web.archive.org/web/20220629174224/https://neocities.org/site/myfirsthtmlwebsite). Despite the number of few views, the website would get some attention, mostly from people posting on the profile for it giving their distaste for it.

The website would be taken offline soon, at least a day later on 2022-06-30.

Reviewing [the Internet Archive map for the website](https://web.archive.org/web/sitemap/https://myfirsthtmlwebsite.neocities.org), only the `index.html` was saved, although seeing that the site was only online for probably less than a day and that [the only automatic update we can see is of the same page](https://web.archive.org/web/20220629174238/https://neocities.org/site/myfirsthtmlwebsite?page=2), then it might be a safe bet to say that we have been able to save all of the site.

The website itself does not have all that much content on it, apart from text that encourages the reader to kill themself with reasons like "Everyone hates you", "You make people lose their appetite easily", and "You lack social cues" (the website owner is seemingly unaware that it is rude to try and get other people to commit suicide). The website also features GIFs of Hatsune Miku, acting as some kind of weird juxtaposition for the whole thing.

It is unknown who made the website, despite this, the website's HTML has been written fairly well with no real errors, arguably, the only thing wrong with the website, disregarding the distasteful text, is that the owner decided not to use CSS at all on it, instead opting to use the `<style>` tag (line 8 to 16), but even that can be ignored as the site is so small.

All of the images on the site were hotlinked off of websites like DuckDuckGo, so two versions of the site were made; `index.html` that has been edited by Cass Python for this git so that images are no longer hotlinked and `index_og.html` for the original webpage where images have been hotlinked - note that this version of the website will have broken images at some point in time.
